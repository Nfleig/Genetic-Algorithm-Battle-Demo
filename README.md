# Genetic Algorithm

This demo simulates a battle between two armies that are controlled by genetic algorithms designed to find the best possible strategy to win. You can modify the settings of both AIs to see how they effect the strategies that the AIs produce and ultimately the outcome of the battle.

The MacOS and Windows builds of the demo can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/Nfleig/Genetic-Algorithm-Battle-Demo/releases)

A detailed write-up of how this project works, along with a playable web demo, can be found on my personal website:
